# kojo-gaming
This is the Gaming extension for Kojo.

Here are some of the high-level features of kojo-gaming:
- It has a simple to use (with school-children being a part of the target audience) entity component system with the following features:
  - animated sprites with rendering based on textures, texture atlases, and particle systems.
  - simple physics (kinematics).
  - collision detection and response.
  - world boundary behaviors (bouncing, wrapping, etc).
  - and more...
- It is hardware accelerated for good performance - based on OpenGL via LibGDX and LWJGL (the tech used by Minecraft!)
- Games made in Kojo can be exported to [Desktop or Mobile](https://github.com/litan/kojo-gaming-template).
- It also (as of the upcoming version 0.4.0) supports picture based gaming, for an easy transition for children who are familiar with pictures in Kojo.

You can play with some example games here:
